# NeedlePath

<strong>Disclaimer: </strong>This software is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for clinical judgment.

In some CT-guided procedures, there is no axial slice with a safe path from the skin surface to the target, but there may be an oblique ("out-of-plane") approach.  Estimating the proper needle angles for such procedures may be difficult without visualization tools.  

NeedlePath is a Windows program to calculate in-plane and out-of-plane needle angles for difficult CT-guided needle placements.  The program  accepts a series of DICOM images from either the Synapse 5 PACS or a folder of DICOM files, and allows the user to mark the start position and the target on the images.  NeedlePath shows the projected needle path as well as the in-plane and out-of-plane needle angles.
